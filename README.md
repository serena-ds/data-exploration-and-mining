# Case Studies and Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the code and analyses for three machine learning case studies, developed as part of a group assignment. The work was collaboratively completed by three team members, utilising Python Jupyter Notebooks.

## Folders
- [**Case Study 1**](https://github.com/serena-ds/data-exploration-and-mining/tree/main/Case%20Study%201) folder: Association mining on online retail data to discover common purchase patterns.
- [**Case Study 2**](https://github.com/serena-ds/data-exploration-and-mining/tree/main/Case%20Study%202) folder: Clustering diabetic patient encounters to identify useful patient clusters.
- [**Case Study 3**](https://github.com/serena-ds/data-exploration-and-mining/tree/main/Case%20Study%203) folder: Three machine learning models for predicting diabetic patient readmission.

## Case Study 1: Association Mining
### Objective: 
Analyze online retail data to identify common items purchased together.
### Tasks:
- Pre-process the dataset D1.csv.
- Perform association mining and determine thresholds for support and confidence.
- Report top-5 rules and common items purchased with "JUMBO BAG PINK POLKADOT".
- Explore sequence analysis if applicable.
- Discuss potential use of results for decision-makers.

## Case Study 2: Clustering
### Objective: 
Discover clusters of diabetic patient encounters from D2.csv.
### Tasks:
- Pre-process the dataset and select clustering algorithm.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluate clustering results.
- Visualize and describe clusters; explore profiling by specific races.
- Discuss how results can benefit decision-makers.

## Case Study 3: Predictive Modeling
### Objective: 
Build and evaluate predictive models to classify diabetic patient readmission from D3.csv.
### Tasks:
- Decision Tree: Pre-process data, build and tune models, and compare results.
- Regression: Build and tune regression models, explore dimensionality reduction.
- Neural Networks: Build, tune, and evaluate neural network models, and assess the impact of feature selection.
- Final evaluation of models for decision-making, including ROC curves and accuracy comparisons.
